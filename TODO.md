# Next Steps: Game Improvements

## 1. User Interaction
- [ ] Implement manual card selection for passing.
- [ ] Implement manual card selection for playing.
- [ ] Allow player to choose to shoot the moon if applicable (or make it automatic based on rules).

## 2. Output and Logging Cleanup
- [ ] Review all `print()` statements for clarity and necessity.
- [ ] Differentiate between debug logs and player-facing game information.
- [ ] Implement a more structured display of game state (e.g., scores, current trick, whose turn).
- [ ] Consider a "verbose" or "debug" mode flag to control log output.

## 4. Code Refinements
- [ ] Review code for any further potential bugs or edge cases.
- [ ] Add more comments and documentation where needed.
- [ ] Ensure all network resources are consistently released.

## 5. Testing
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of manual play.
- [ ] Test edge cases for scoring (Shooting the Moon).
